# RTX Options
RTX Options are configurable parameters for RTX pipeline components. They can be set via rtx.conf in a following format:

```
<RTX Option int scalar> = <Integer value>
<RTX Option float scalar> = <Floating point value>
<RTX Option int vector> = <Integer value>, <Integer value>, ...
<RTX Option float vector> = <Floating point value>, <Floating point value>, ...
<RTX Option boolean> = True/False
<RTX Option string> = <String value, no quotes>
<RTX Option hash set/vector> = <Hex string>, <Hex string>, ...
```

Practical examples of syntax:

```
rtx.someIntScalar = 38
rtx.someFloatScalar = 29.39
rtx.someIntVector = 1, -2, 3
rtx.someFloatVector = 1.0, -2.0, 3.0
rtx.someBoolean = True
# Note: Leading whitespace in a string is removed, allowing for nicer option formatting like this without messing up the string.
# Additionally, strings should not be surrounded with quotes as these will be treated as part of the string.
rtx.someString = This is a string
# Note: 0x prefix on hash hex values here is optional, similarly these values are case-insensitive. 16 hex characters = 64 bit hash.
rtx.someHashSet = 8DD6F568BD126398, EEF8EFD4B8A1B2A5, ...
```

RTX Options may be set in multiple places, specifically a hardcoded set in `src/util/config/config.cpp` which is assigned per-application based on process name, and the two user-configurable files `dxvk.conf` and `rtx.conf`. If not set the options will inherit their default values.
The full order of precedence for how each set of options overrides the previous is as follows:

1. Default option value (Implicit)
2. `dxvk.conf` ("User Config")
3. Per-application `config.cpp` configuration ("Built-in Config")
4. `rtx.conf` ("RTX User Config")
  1. `baseGameModPath/rtx.conf` (Mod-specific extension of "RTX User Config")

Additionally, upon saving options from the Remix UI options are written only to rtx.conf.

Tables below enumerate all the options and their defaults set by RTX Remix. Note that this information is auto-generated by the RTX Remix application. To re-generate this file, run Remix with `DXVK_DOCUMENTATION_WRITE_RTX_OPTIONS_MD=1` defined in the environment variables.

|rtx.enableFallbackLightViewPrimaryAxis|bool|False|Enables usage of the camera's view axis as the primary axis for the fallback light's shaping \(only used for non \- Distant light types\)\. Typically the shaping primary axis may be specified directly, but if desired it may be set to the camera's view axis for a "flashlight" effect\.|
|rtx.enableFirstBounceLobeProbabilityDithering|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable screen\-space probability dithering on the first indirect lobe sampled\.<br>Generally sampling a diffuse, specular or other lobe relies on a random number generated against the probability of sampling each lobe, effectively focusing more rays/paths on lobes which matter more\.<br>This can cause issues however with denoisers which do not handle sparse stochastic signals \(like those from path tracing\) well as they may be expecting a more "complete" signal like those used in simpler branching ray tracing setups\.<br>To help solve this issue this option uses a temporal screenspace dithering based on the probability rather than a purely random choice to determine which lobe to sample from on the first indirect bounce\.<br>This as a result helps ensure there will always be a diffuse or specular sample within the dithering pattern's area and should help the denoising resolve a more stable result\.|
|rtx.enableFog|bool|True||
|rtx.enableFogColorRemap|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable remapping fixed function fox's color\. Only takes effect when fog remapping in general is enabled\.<br>Enables or disables remapping functionality relating to the color parameter of fixed function fog with the exception of the multiscattering scale \(as this scale can be set to 0 to disable it\)\.<br>This allows dynamic changes to the game's fog color to be reflected somewhat in the volumetrics system\. Overrides the specified volumetric transmittance color\.|
|rtx.enableFogMaxDistanceRemap|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable remapping fixed function fox's max distance\. Only takes effect when fog remapping in general is enabled\.<br>Enables or disables remapping functionality relating to the max distance parameter of fixed function fog\.<br>This allows dynamic changes to the game's fog max distance to be reflected somewhat in the volumetrics system\. Overrides the specified volumetric transmittance measurement distance\.|
|rtx.enableFogRemap|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable fixed function fog remapping\. Only takes effect when volumetrics are enabled\.<br>Typically many old games used fixed function fog for various effects and while sometimes this fog can be replaced with proper volumetrics globally, other times require some amount of dynamic behavior controlled by the game\.<br>When enabled this option allows for remapping of fixed function fog parameters from the game to volumetric parameters to accomodate this dynamic need\.|
|rtx.enableIndirectTranslucentShadows|bool|False|Include OBJECT\_MASK\_TRANSLUCENT into secondary visibility rays\.|
|rtx.enableNearPlaneOverride|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable the Camera's near plane override feature\.<br>Since the camera is not used directly for ray tracing the near plane the application uses typically does not matter, but for certain matrix\-based operations \(such as temporal reprojection or voxel grid projection\) it is still relevant\.<br>The issue arises when geometry is ray traced that is behind where the chosen Camera's near plane is located, typically common on viewmodels especially with how they are ray traced, causing graphical artifacts and other issues\.<br>This option helps correct this issue by overriding the near plane value to else \(usually smaller\) to sit behind the objects in question \(such as the view model\)\. As such this option should usually be enabled on games with viewmodels\.<br>Do note that when adjusting the near plane the larger the relative magnitude gap between the near and far plane the worse the precision of matrix operations will be, so the near plane should be set as high as possible even when overriding\.|
|rtx.enablePSRR|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable reflection PSR \(Primary Surface Replacement\)\.<br>When enabled this feature allows higher quality mirror\-like reflections in special cases by replacing the G\-Buffer's surface with the reflected surface\.<br>Should usually be enabled for the sake of quality as almost all applications will utilize it in the form of glass or mirrors\.|
|rtx.enablePSTR|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable transmission PSR \(Primary Surface Replacement\)\.<br>When enabled this feature allows higher quality glass\-like refraction in special cases by replacing the G\-Buffer's surface with the refracted surface\.<br>Should usually be enabled for the sake of quality as almost all applications will utilize it in the form of glass\.|
|rtx.enablePSTROutgoingSplitApproximation|bool|True|Enable transmission PSR on outgoing transmission events such as leaving translucent materials \(rather than respecting no\-split path PSR rule\)\.<br>Typically this results in better looking glass when enabled \(at the cost of accuracy due to ignoring non\-TIR inter\-reflections within the glass itself\)\.|
|rtx.enablePSTRSecondaryIncidentSplitApproximation|bool|True|Enable transmission PSR on secondary incident transmission events such as entering a translucent material on an already\-transmitted path \(rather than respecting no\-split path PSR rule\)\.<br>Typically this results in better looking glass when enabled \(at the cost accuracy due to ignoring reflections off of glass seen through glass for example\)\.|
|rtx.enablePortalFadeInEffect|bool|False||
|rtx.enablePresentThrottle|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable present throttling, when set to true a sleep for a time specified by the throttle delay will be inserted into the DXVK presentation thread\.<br>Useful to manually reduce the framerate if the application is running too fast or to reduce GPU power usage during development to keep temperatures down\.<br>Should not be enabled in anything other than development situations\.|
|rtx.enablePreviousTLAS|bool|True||
|rtx.enableRaytracing|bool|True|Globally enables or disables ray tracing\. When set to false the original game should render mostly as it would in DXVK typically\.<br>Some artifacts may still appear however compared to the original game either due to issues with the underlying DXVK translation or issues in Remix itself\.|
|rtx.enableReplacementAssets|bool|True|Globally enables or disables all enhanced asset replacement \(materials, meshes, lights\) functionality\.|
|rtx.enableReplacementLights|bool|True|Enables or disables enhanced light replacements\.<br>Requires replacement assets in general to be enabled to have any effect\.|
|rtx.enableReplacementMaterials|bool|True|Enables or disables enhanced material replacements\.<br>Requires replacement assets in general to be enabled to have any effect\.|
|rtx.enableReplacementMeshes|bool|True|Enables or disables enhanced mesh replacements\.<br>Requires replacement assets in general to be enabled to have any effect\.|
|rtx.enableRussianRoulette|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable Russian Roulette, a rendering technique to give paths a chance of terminating randomly with each bounce based on their importance\.<br>This is usually useful to have enabled as it will ensure useless paths are terminated earlier while more important paths are allowed to accumulate more bounces\.<br>Furthermore this allows for the renderer to remain unbiased whereas a hard clamp on the number of bounces will introduce bias \(though this is also done in Remix for the sake of performance\)\.<br>On the other hand, randomly terminating paths too aggressively may leave threads in GPU warps without work which may hurt thread occupancy when not used with a thread\-reordering technique like SER\.|
|rtx.enableSecondaryBounces|bool|True|Enables indirect lighting \(lighting from diffuse/specular bounces to one or more other surfaces\) on surfaces when set to true, otherwise disables it\.|
|rtx.enableSeparateUnorderedApproximations|bool|True|Use a separate loop during resolving for surfaces which can have lighting evaluated in an approximate unordered way on each path segment \(such as particles\)\.<br>This improves performance typically in how particles or decals are rendered and should usually always be enabled\.<br>Do note however the unordered nature of this resolving method may result in visual artifacts with large numbers of stacked particles due to difficulty in determining the intended order\.<br>Additionally, unordered approximations will only be done on the first indirect ray bounce \(as particles matter less in higher bounces\), and only if enabled by its corresponding setting\.|
|rtx.enableShaderExecutionReorderingInPathtracerGbuffer|bool|False|\(Note: Hard disabled in shader code\) Enables Shader Execution Reordering \(SER\) in GBuffer Raytrace pass if SER is supported\.|
|rtx.enableShaderExecutionReorderingInPathtracerIntegrateIndirect|bool|True|Enables Shader Execution Reordering \(SER\) in Integrate Indirect pass if SER is supported\.|
|rtx.enableStochasticAlphaBlend|bool|True|Use stochastic alpha blend\.|
|rtx.enableUnorderedEmissiveParticlesInIndirectRays|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable unordered resolve emissive particles specifically in indirect rays\.<br>Should be enabled in higher quality rendering modes as emissive particles are fairly important in reflections, but may be disabled to skip such interactions which can improve performance on lower end hardware\.<br>Note that rtx\.enableUnorderedResolveInIndirectRays must first be enabled for this option to take any effect \(as it will control if unordered resolve is used to begin with in indirect rays\)\.|
|rtx.enableUnorderedResolveInIndirectRays|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable unordered resolve approximations in indirect rays\.<br>This allows for the presence of unordered approximations in resolving to be overridden in indirect rays and as such requires separate unordered approximations to be enabled to have any effect\.<br>This option should be enabled if objects which can be resolvered in an unordered way in indirect rays are expected for higher quality in reflections, but may come at a performance cost\.<br>Note that even with this option enabled, unordered resolve approximations are only done on the first indirect bounce for the sake of performance overall\.|
|rtx.enableVolumetricLighting|bool|False|Enabling volumetric lighting provides higher quality ray traced physical volumetrics, disabling falls back to cheaper depth based fog\.<br>Note that disabling this option does not disable the froxel radiance cache as a whole as it is still needed for other non\-volumetric lighting approximations\.|
|rtx.enableVolumetricsInPortals|bool|True|Enables using extra frustum\-aligned volumes for lighting in portals\.<br>Note that enabling this option will require 3x the memory of the typical froxel grid as well as degrade performance in some cases\.<br>This option should be enabled always in games using ray portals for proper looking volumetrics through them, but should be disabled on any game not using ray portals\.<br>Additionally, this setting must be set at startup and changing it will not take effect at runtime\.|

|rtx.fallbackLightMode|int|1|The mode to determine when to create a fallback light\.<br>Never \(0\) never creates the light, NoLightsPresent \(1\) creates the fallback light only when no lights are provided to Remix, and Always \(2\) always creates the fallback light\.<br>Primarily a debugging feature, users should create their own lights via the Remix workflow rather than relying on this feature to provide lighting\.<br>As such, this option should be set to Never for "production" builds of Remix creations to avoid the fallback light from appearing in games unintentionally in cases where no lights exist \(which is the default behavior when set to NoLightsPresent\)\.|
|rtx.fallbackLightPositionOffset|float3|0, 0, 0|The position offset from the camera origin to use for the fallback light \(used only for non\-Distant light types\)\.|
|rtx.fallbackLightPrimaryAxis|float3|0, 0, -1|The primary axis to use for the fallback light shaping \(used only for non\-Distant light types\)\.|

|rtx.fogColorScale|float|0.25||
|rtx.fogRemapColorMultiscatteringScale|float|1|A value representing the scale of the fixed function fog's color in the multiscattering approximation\.<br>This scaling factor is applied to the fixed function fog's color and becomes a multiscattering approximation in the volumetrics system\.<br>Sometimes useful but this multiscattering approximation is very basic \(just a simple ambient term for now essentially\) and may not look very good depending on various conditions\.|
|rtx.fogRemapMaxDistanceMax|float|4000|A value controlling the "max distance" fixed function fog parameter's maximum remapping bound\.<br>Note that fog remapping and fog max distance remapping must be enabled for this setting to have any effect\.|

|rtx.forceCameraJitter|bool|False||

|rtx.rngSeedWithFrameIndex|bool|True|Indicates that pseudo\-random number generator should be seeded with the frame number of the application every frame, otherwise seed with 0\.<br>This should generally always be enabled as without the frame index each frame will typically be identical in the random values that are produced which will result in incorrect rendering\.

|rtx.tonemappingMode|int|1|The tonemapping type to use, 0 for Global, 1 for Local \(Default\)\.<br>Global tonemapping tonemaps the image with respect to global parameters, usually based on statistics about the rendered image as a whole\.<br>Local tonemapping on the other hand uses more spatially\-local parameters determined by regions of the rendered image rather than the whole image\.<br>Local tonemapping can result in better preservation of highlights and shadows in scenes with high amounts of dynamic range whereas global tonemapping may have to comprimise between over or underexposure\.|
|rtx.translucentDecalAlbedoFactor|float|10|A global scale factor applied to the albedo of decals that are applied to a translucent base material, to make the decals more visible\.<br>This is generally needed as albedo values for decals may be fairly low when dealing with opaque surfaces, but the translucent diffuse layer requires a fairly high albedo value to result in an expected look\.<br>The need for this option could be avoided by simply authoring decals applied to translucent materials with a higher albedo to begin with, but sometimes applications may share decals between different material types\.|
|rtx.translucentMaterial.enableDiffuseLayerOverride|bool|False|A flag to force the diffuse layer on the translucent material to be enabled\. Should only be used for debugging or development\.|

|rtx.upscalingMipBias|float|0|Specifies a mipmapping level bias to add to all material texture filtering when upscaling \(such as DLSS\) is used\.<br>Mipmaps are determined based on how far away a texture is, using this can bias the desired level in a lower quality direction \(positive bias\), or a higher quality direction with potentially more aliasing \(negative bias\)\.<br>Note that mipmaps are also important for good spatial caching of textures, so too far negative of a mip bias may start to significantly affect performance, therefore changing this value is not recommended|
|rtx.useAnisotropicFiltering|bool|True|A flag to indicate if anisotropic filtering should be used on material textures, otherwise typical trilinear filtering will be used\.<br>This should generally be enabled as anisotropic filtering allows for less blurring on textures at grazing angles than typical trilinear filtering with only usually minor performance impact \(depending on the max anisotropy samples\)\.|
|rtx.useBuffersDirectly|bool|True|When enabled Remix will use the incoming vertex buffers directly where possible instead of copying data\. Note: setting the d3d9\.allowDiscard to False will disable this option\.|
|rtx.useDenoiser|bool|True|Enables usage of denoiser\(s\) when set to true, otherwise disables denoising when set to false\.<br>Denoising is important for filtering the raw noisy ray traced signal into a smoother and more stable result at the cost of some potential spatial/temporal artifacts \(ghosting, boiling, blurring, etc\)\.<br>Generally should remain enabled except when debugging behavior which requires investigating the output directly, or diagnosing denoising\-related issues\.|
|rtx.useDenoiserReferenceMode|bool|False|Enables the reference "denoiser" when set to true, otherwise uses the standard denoiser when set to false\. Note this requires the denoiser to be enabled to function\.<br>The reference denoiser allows for a reference multi\-sample per pixel contribution to accumulate which should converge slowly to the ideal result the renderer is working towards\.<br>Useful for analyzing quality differences in various denoising methods, post\-processing filters, or for more accurately comparing subtle effects of potentially biased rendering techniques which may be hard to see through usual noise and filtering\.<br>Also useful for higher quality artistic renders of a scene beyond what is possible in realtime\.|

|rtx.useObsoleteHashOnTextureUpload|bool|False|Whether or not to use slower XXH64 hash on texture upload\.<br>New projects should not enable this option as this solely exists for compatibility with older hashing schemes\.|
|rtx.usePartialDdsLoader|bool|True|A flag controlling if the partial DDS loader should be used, true to enable, false to disable and use GLI instead\.<br>Generally this should be always enabled as it allows for simple parsing of DDS header information without loading the entire texture into memory like GLI does to retrieve similar information\.<br>Should only be set to false for debugging purposes if the partial DDS loader's logic is suspected to be incorrect to compare against GLI's implementation\.|
|rtx.usePostFilter|bool|True|Uses post filter to remove fireflies in the denoised result\.|
|rtx.useRTXDI|bool|True|A flag indicating if RTXDI should be used, true enables RTXDI, false disables it and falls back on simpler light sampling methods\.<br>RTXDI provides improved direct light sampling quality over traditional methods and should generally be enabled for improved direct lighting quality at the cost of some performance\.|
|rtx.useRayPortalVirtualInstanceMatching|bool|True||
|rtx.useReSTIRGI|bool|True|A flag indicating if ReSTIR GI should be used, true enables ReSTIR GI, false disables it and relies on typical GI sampling\.<br>ReSTIR GI provides improved indirect path sampling over typical importance sampling and should usually be enabled for better indirect diffuse and specular GI quality at the cost of some performance\.|
|rtx.useVertexCapture|bool|True|When enabled, injects code into the original vertex shader to capture final shaded vertex positions\.  Is useful for games using simple vertex shaders, that still also set the fixed function transform matrices\.|
|rtx.useVertexCapturedNormals|bool|True|When enabled, vertex normals are read from the input assembler and used in raytracing\.  This doesn't always work as normals can be in any coordinate space, but can help sometimes\.|
|rtx.useVirtualShadingNormalsForDenoising|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable the usage of virtual shading normals for denoising passes\.<br>This is primairly important for anything that modifies the direction of a primary ray, so mainly PSR and ray portals as both of these will view a surface from an angle different from the "virtual" viewing direction perceived by the camera\.<br>This can cause some issues with denoising due to the normals not matching the expected perception of what the normals should be, for example normals facing away from the camera direction due to being viewed from a different angle via refraction or portal teleportation\.<br>To correct this, virtual normals are calculcated such that they always are oriented relative to the primary camera ray as if its direction was never altered, matching the virtual perception of the surface from the camera's point of view\.<br>As an aside, virtual normals themselves can cause issues with denoising due to the normals suddenly changing from virtual to "real" normals upon traveling through a portal, causing surface consistency failures in the denoiser, but this is accounted for via a special transform given to the denoiser on camera ray portal teleportation events\.<br>As such, this option should generally always be enabled when rendering with ray portals in the scene to have good denoising quality\.|
|rtx.useWhiteMaterialMode|bool|False||
|rtx.validateCPUIndexData|bool|False||
|rtx.vertexColorStrength|float|0.6|A scalar to apply to how strong vertex color influence should be on materials\.<br>A value of 1 indicates that it should be fully considered \(though do note the texture operation and relevant parameters still control how much it should be blended with the actual albedo color\), a value of 0 indicates that it should be fully ignored\.|

|rtx.volumetricEnableTemporalResampling|bool|True|Indicates if temporal resampling should be used for volume integration\.<br>Temporal resampling allows for reuse of temporal information when picking froxel grid light samples similar to how ReSTIR works, providing higher quality light samples\.<br>This should generally be enabled but currently due to the lack of temporal bias correction this option will slightly bias the lighting result\.|
|rtx.volumetricInitialRISSampleCount|int|8|The number of RIS samples to select from the global pool of lights when constructing a Reservoir sample\.<br>Higher values generally increases the quality of the selected light sample, though similar to the general RIS light sample count has diminishing returns\.|
