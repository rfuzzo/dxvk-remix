    * \brief Implements a generic thread watchdog for tracking
    *        conditional changes where latency isn't a problem.
    *
    *  TimeoutMS: Time between each query of the condition
    * 
    *  condition: Conditions under which we should signal the watchdog
    *  threadName: Name of the watchdog thread
    * 
    *  Example usage:
    *   // Writes "Ping" into the log every second.
    *   Watchdog<1000> watchdog([]{return true;}, "ping every second");
    *   while(1) { if(watchdog.hasSignaled()) Logger::Info("Ping"); }
