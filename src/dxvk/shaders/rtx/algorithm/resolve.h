// on translucency are desired the ray masks and resolve approximation flags should reflect this, whereas for NEE rays where

// of denoising them. This flag should be used in unordered integration rays only. The macro RESOLVE_OPACITY_LIGHTING_APPROXIMATION
// should be used in addition to it (this is because the light approximation code references a texture not present in other passes).
